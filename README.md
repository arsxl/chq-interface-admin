<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Coders Headquarters (CodersHQ) is a social platform for developers to grow, network, challenge themselves, and gain points by contributing and helping others in this community. This platform was built by the community and for the community. The essence of CodersHq is to inspire everyone to learn to code, share knowledge and learn together.

The CodersHQ Interface project aims to build an interface to work with the backend of the project, this is through a Web User-Interface, which will be used to perform various tasks.</p>

<h3 id="adminpage">:man_technologist: Admin Page</h3>
<p> The Admin Page is a web interface intended to be connected with the backend of CodersHQ's platform, the functionality that the admin page's interface provides should be, but not limited to:
  <ol>
    <li>Logging in</li>
    <li>See developers on the platform</li>
    <li>Create Events</li>
    <li>Modify Events</li>
    <li>Delete Events</li>
  </ol>
To inspire, below will be attached designs which can be used to understand the design language expected, the design being looked for. This however does not mean that the designs need to be exactly based on the screenshots provided. Designs can be different and changes can be proposed.
